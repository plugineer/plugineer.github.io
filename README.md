### Problem
We identified a need for some essential plugins and extensions, which are part of the Content Management System (CMS).

### Solution
The solution proposed is to develop key plugins for CMS like like Joomla, Magento, OpenCart, PrestaShop, Shopify, WooCommerce.

### Value proposition / Unique Selling Proposition
Plugineer is the place to find flexible and easy to use plugins.

### Customer segment
Our target market are the users of the popular CMS platforms like Joomla, Magento, or Prestashop. We analyzed various marketplaces and we came to the conclusion they do not have some key plugins and extensions that users could benefit from.

### Competitive advantage
- Developing plugins designed to meet our customersâ€™ needs
- Intuitive and easy to use plugins and extensions 


### Key metrics
- Publishing our first plugin and promoting it to gain new customers

### Cost structure
- hosting services
