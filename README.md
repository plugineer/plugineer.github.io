### Problem
The problem is that there are a need for some essential plugins and extensions on the niche Content Management Systems.

### Solution
The solution is developing essential plugins for Content Management Systems like Joomla, Magento, OpenCart, PrestaShop, Shopify, WooCommerce.

### Value proposition
We receive the plugin requests from the users of Content Management Systems and we start implementing extensions to meet the clients needs.

### Customer segment
We target the users of CMS like Joomla, Magento, OpenCart, PrestaShop. The marketplaces does not contain some essential plugins and extensions for these platforms.

### Competition
- marketplaces where every developer can sell plugins and extensions for CMS (e.g. https://themeforest.net/)

### The advantage over competition
- plugins made up to meet the clients needs
- intuitive and easy to use plugins

### Key metrics
- in the launching phase (publishing our first plugin) we need to advertise our product to bring new users
- number of free trial users
- number of subscription renewals

### Cost structure
- hosting services
- advertising and promotion
- employee expenses

### Revenue streams
Our revenue stream will make up of recurring revenue. We want to provide some subscription plans billed monthly or annualy.
